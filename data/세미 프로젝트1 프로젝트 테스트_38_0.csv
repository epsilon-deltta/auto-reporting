When, for example, some dies are transferred from, e.g., a first lot to a second lot, the entire die information associated with the first lot is copied to the second lot, and a different index string is assigned to the second lot to indicate the actual dies or range of dies that have been transferred.

Since then, many others including Ampere, Faraday, Ohm, and Oersted managed to develop simple electrical devices after having understood the basic electrical principles. Much later, in 1904, Fleming's diode opened a new horizon for the advent of electronic components.\n\nElectric devices, vehicles and communicational systems have been available since then; home appl", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og:url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev658544.app941503&hl=ko&gl=US"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WPPrR3YSAAPJY7vZDCPVgpdxCKurcb9VV7xIS3JOZsoUSx6wwZyGzEAIzTMltQ5JXQ"}]}}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "EP1810326A1 - Die-level traceability mechanism for semiconductor ...", "htmlTitle": "EP1810326A1 - Die-level traceability mechanism for semiconductor ...", "link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1810326A1/en", "displayLink": "patents.google.com", "snippet": "G06Q10/06 Resources, workflows, human or project management, e.g. ... for \nexample, one factory or lot of a semiconductor assembly and test facility to \nanother.", "htmlSnippet": "G06Q10/06 Resources, workflows, human or <b>project</b> management, e.g. ... for <br>\nexample, <b>one</b> factory or lot of a semiconductor assembly and <b>test</b> facility to <br>\nanother.", "cacheId": "Gzzf8uf48SIJ", "formattedUrl": "https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1810326A1/en", "htmlFormattedUrl": "https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1810326A1/en", "pagemap": {"metatags": [{"referrer": "origin-when-crossorigin", "citation_patent_application_number": "EP:05804118A", "dc.description": "Embodiments of the present invention provide a novel method, system and computer program product for tracing die units during material transfer from, for example, one factory or lot to another (and efficiently maintaining correspondence between die data and an individual die during, e.g., a lot transfer process). One or more embodiments of the present invention are intended to improve the mechanism of die-level traceability by assigning individual die IDs to each die unit in, e.g., each lot, and associating a range of die IDs with a corresponding index string. When, for example, some dies are transferred from, e.g., a first lot to a second lot, the entire die information associated with the first lot is copied to the second lot, and a different index string is assigned to the second lot to indicate the actual dies or range of dies that have been transferred.
