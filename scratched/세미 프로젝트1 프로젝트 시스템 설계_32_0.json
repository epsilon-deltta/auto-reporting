Since then, many others including Ampere, Faraday, Ohm, and Oersted managed to develop simple electrical devices after having understood the basic electrical principles. Much later, in 1904, Fleming's diode opened a new horizon for the advent of electronic components.\n\nElectric devices, vehicles and communicational systems have been available since then; home appl", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "og:url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andromo.dev658544.app941503&hl=ko&gl=US"}], "cse_image": [{"src": "https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/WPPrR3YSAAPJY7vZDCPVgpdxCKurcb9VV7xIS3JOZsoUSx6wwZyGzEAIzTMltQ5JXQ"}]}}, {"kind": "customsearch#result", "title": "KR20010000959A - \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac74\ucd95 \uc124\uacc4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uc124\uacc4 \ubc29\ubc95 - Google ...", "htmlTitle": "KR20010000959A - \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac74\ucd95 <b>\uc124\uacc4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c</b> \ubc0f <b>\uc124\uacc4</b> \ubc29\ubc95 - Google ...", "link": "https://patents.google.com/patent/KR20010000959A/ko", "displayLink": "patents.google.com", "snippet": "View 1 more classifications.
